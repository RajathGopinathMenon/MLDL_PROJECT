# **TODOs**  
- **Step 1:**  
   - Read papers and research the main methodologies for 6D pose estimation.  
   
- **Step 2:**  
   - Implement an object detection system (given an RGB image, it returns the bounding boxes of the objects).  
     We can use methods like Faster R-CNN or YOLO (You Only Look Once) with pre-trained models, which we'll fine-tune.  
     YOLO is significantly faster during both training and inference.  

- **Step 3:**  
   - Develop a model that can estimate the 6D pose given an RGB image and the bounding boxes of the detected objects.  

- **Step 4:**  
   - Extend the pipeline by leveraging other available information in the dataset (depth data and 3D models of the objects), along with any other relevant additions.
